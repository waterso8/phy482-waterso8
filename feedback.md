In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 1

Alyssa, the idea of the physics of thunderstorms is pretty cool in my opnion. I think there's a lot of interesting physics in it. I would suggest that you try to read an introduction to the field and then get into the detailed work of reading research papers. The studies can be a bit much if you haven't studied the theory that underlies their results. Here's a link to a book chapter that might help:

Also, the American Journal of Physics has a wealth of information on lightning. Go to ajp.aapt.org and search for lightning and/or thunder and you will find a number of peer-reviewed articles. For Friday, I'd suggest that you read the Technical Physics arrticle that you have in your list and one other article. Great work so far!
