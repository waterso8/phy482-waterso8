# Feedback on Project Work
## Alyssa Waterson

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 5

Alyssa, great idea to present a couple of options here. I think of the two, the Monte Carlo work is more aligned with the spirit of the paper (i.e., present how people model these really cool phenomenon). So, I'd usggest that you do more general unpacking of Monte Carlo simulations and how they are developed, then dig into the specifics of how the simulations that you are presenting in the paper using Monte Carlo. Typically, in Monte Carlo sims you are using so sort of random process to gain a statistical measure of something (that's a general statement), but if you think about finding pi. you randomly drop dots and then you count all the dots inside the unit circle compared to all the ones you dropped. So see if you can come up with the way the lightning is modeled with the MC sim at that level of discussion.

## Assignment 4

Alyssa, I think what you have written here helps me understand what you intend to dig into, so I appreciate that. Much of the writing you have done could be worked into the introduction of your paper. But, I still want more details of how the modeling is done. I found the "avalanche of electrons" to be quite suggestive of some sort of interesting model that you could describe, but I think more interestingly was the piece at the end about the Monte Carlo simulations of lightning. I think if you can unpack how folks model lightning in some section of your paper and the describe how Monte Carlo simulations work in this context, you would have a near complete paper that describes the physics of lightning (at least in some restricted context). Moreover, you will have set yourself up for the second project: making a theoretical and computational model of lightning (if you wanted to do that). So, my feedback is more details on the models, but maybe think about digging into the Monte Carlo sim and how it works in some detail.

## Assignment 3

Alyssa, I'm glad to see that you are focusing on the electrical properties of a thunderstorm. In particular, the article about the physics of lightning seems to have been very helpful in connecting your interests to E&M. I'm still a touch confused abotu what specific aspects of this you are intending to present, so that will need to be clear in your writeup for this week, which is meant to synthesize across the reading that you have done and to present a coherent narrative of what you are intending your project to focus on. That doesn't necessairly mean that you are done reading papers, but rather I want to be able to give you feedback on the narrative that you are preparing.

## Assignment 2

Alyssa, it appears that the two papers that you read for this week covered the introduction and are helping you to focus your efforts. I think what I'd like to know better for next week is what aspect(s) of this work you are planning to dig into for your paper. Some of that will be based on the reading that you are doing, but it will also need to be communicated in your summaries - like you have started to do with the Dwyer article. You will also need to begin digging into the mathematical models that are being developed for this work as your paper will need to include both a conceptual and mathematical descirption of the aspect(s) that you are digging into. These summaries are very helpful and for next week I'm looking for you to go deeper.

## Assignment 1

Alyssa, the idea of the physics of thunderstorms is pretty cool in my opnion. I think there's a lot of interesting physics in it. I would suggest that you try to read an introduction to the field and then get into the detailed work of reading research papers. The studies can be a bit much if you haven't studied the theory that underlies their results. Here's a link to a book chapter that might help:

Also, the American Journal of Physics has a wealth of information on lightning. Go to ajp.aapt.org and search for lightning and/or thunder and you will find a number of peer-reviewed articles. For Friday, I'd suggest that you read the Technical Physics article that you have in your list and one other article. Great work so far!
